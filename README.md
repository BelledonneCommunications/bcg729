# About bcg729

Bcg729 is an opensource implementation of both encoder and decoder of the ITU G729 Annex A/B speech codec. 

The library written in C 99 is fully portable and can be executed on many platforms including both ARM and x86 processors. 
libbcg729 supports concurrent channels encoding/decoding for multi call application such as conferencing. 
This project was initially developed as part of Mediastreamer2, the Linphone's media processing engine.
This is why it also contains the glue to be integrated in Linphone/Mediastreamer2.
 
# Licensing

The source code is licensed under GPLv2. ITU G729 Annex A/B were offically released October/November 1996 (https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.729),
hence all patents covering these specifications shall have expired in November 2016.
Patent pool administrator confirmed most licensed patents under the G.729 Consortium have expired (http://www.sipro.com/G729.html).

# Compilation

By default, the upstream package installs into /usr/local.  Please use
'./configure --prefix' to change it

Linphone plugin is compiled if both mediastremer2 and ortp are installed.
 
# Tests suite

- Tests are defined for each functional bloc (more or less matching a source file)
and for global encoding/decoding

- Use 'make check' to compile and run all tests available in the test directory.

- Input tests pattern have been generated by ITU code using ITU tests patterns.
The test patterns are not part of this repository but can be downloaded here:
http://www.belledonne-communications.com/downloads/bcg729-patterns.zip
However, the first run of 'make check' will get them for you.

- To run partial test, use perl executable 'testCampaign' in the test directory.
'./testCampaign <functional bloc name>'
You must first download the tests patterns using 'make check' or manually
