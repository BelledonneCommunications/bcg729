By default, the upstream package installs into /usr/local.  Please use
'./configure --prefix' to change it

# Tests suite:
- Tests are defined for each functional bloc (more or less matching a source file)
and for global encoding/decoding

- Use 'make check' to compile and run all tests available in the test directory.

- Input tests pattern have been generated by ITU code using ITU tests patterns.
The test patterns are not part of this repository but can be downloaded here:
http://www.belledonne-communications.com/downloads/bcg729-patterns.zip
However, the first run of 'make check' will get them for you.

- To run partial test, use perl executable 'testCampaign' in the test directory.
'./testCampaign <functional bloc name>'
You must first download the tests patterns using 'make check' or manually
